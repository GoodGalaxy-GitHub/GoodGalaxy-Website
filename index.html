            <p>GoodGalaxy started out as a group of friends looking to bring our love for gaming to another level. We initially wanted GoodGalaxy to be a place for us to host multiplayer servers for PC games, however this soon evolved into a place where
                we can share projects we make. These projects are almost always open-source, meaning you can look at and edit the inner-workings of almost everything we make. Additionally, we strive to incorporate community feedback into our projects
                and always try to make things easy and simple to use. So far, we only have the GoodGalaxy Network site which hosts all of our multiplayer servers, however we plan to expand and include many more ideas. So with all of that said, we sincerely
                thank you for visiting our page and taking the time to read this. <br><br> Sincerely,<br> The GoodGalaxy Team
